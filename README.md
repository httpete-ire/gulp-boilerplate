# gulp-boilerplate

I wanted to experiment with the structure of my gulpfile as I found it can easily become messy and unstructured when more tasks are added. I also wanted to apply the design pattern of separation of concerns (SoC) so that each task is kept separate and is in its own file, this allows for tasks to be located and updated easily.

###todo 
- go through each folder and explain
- set up dev:client and dev:server tasks
- dev:client (watches for test, sass and browser sync, lints files)
- dev:server (watches for test, lints files)
